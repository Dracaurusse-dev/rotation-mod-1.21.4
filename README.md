A minecraft mod about rotating entities

Rename your entities with this format:
XDinnerbone-YDinnerbone-ZDinnerbone

Dinnerbone doesnt have to be complete
For instance, Dinne would only rotate the entity 90Â° around the X Axis because Dinner is 5 letter long and Dinnerbone is 10, 5 / 10 = 0.5 so the rotation is half the original rotation

X Y Z represents the spining speed and only accepts integers
